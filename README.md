## User testing guide

* Submit atomic comments using GitHub issues
* Label usage guide:

| Issue label | Usage |
| --- | --- |
| `bug` | application does not work correctly |
| `needs doc` | aplication feature may be nonintuitive should be documented |
| `enchancement` | requests for new features |
| `question` | topics not directly related to development requests |

* Milestone usage guide:

| Milestone | Usage |
| --- | --- |
| `X.Y` | we plan to add the functionality in release `X.Y` |
| `hotfix` | we should fix it as soon as possible, possibly in minor release `X.Y.Z` |
| `unscheduled` | the functionality is planned but beyond last currently planned numbered relase |

[Bogumił Kamiński](https://github.com/bkamins) approves requests for enchancements and assigns them to development milestones.
